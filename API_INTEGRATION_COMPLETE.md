## Testing Checklist

Before testing, ensure:
1. ✅ API server is running on `http://localhost:3001`
2. ✅ `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api`
3. ✅ Next.js dev server restarted after changes

### Test Flows

1. **Login Flow**
   - [ ] Login with valid credentials
   - [ ] Check token stored in localStorage
   - [ ] Verify dashboard loads based on role

2. **Super Admin**
   - [ ] View products from API
   - [ ] Create new product (with image)
   - [ ] Update product
   - [ ] Delete product
   - [ ] View admin requests
   - [ ] Approve/dispatch request (with image)
   - [ ] Reject request with reason

3. **Admin**
   - [ ] View agent requests
   - [ ] Approve/dispatch agent request (with image)
   - [ ] Request stock from super-admin
   - [ ] Transfer stock to another admin
   - [ ] Confirm receipt of dispatched stock (with image)

4. **Agent**
   - [ ] Create B2B sale (with all fields)
   - [ ] Create B2C sale (with all fields)
   - [ ] View sales from API
   - [ ] Create stock request (B2B/B2C)
   - [ ] Confirm receipt of dispatched stock (with image)

## Removed Mock Data

The following files no longer use mock data:
- ✅ `components/dashboards/super-admin-dashboard.tsx`
- ✅ `components/dashboards/admin-dashboard.tsx`
- ✅ `components/dashboards/agent-dashboard.tsx`
- ✅ `components/modals/product-modal.tsx`
- ✅ `components/modals/sales-modal.tsx`
- ✅ `components/modals/stock-request-modal.tsx`
- ✅ All hooks now fetch from API

## Notes

- The `lib/mock-data.ts` file still exists but is no longer imported anywhere
- Old `RequestApprovalModal` exists but is replaced by `EnhancedRequestApprovalModal`
- All image uploads support: JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF (max 5MB)
- Image URLs are automatically formatted using `formatImageUrl()` utility

## Next Steps

1. **Test the complete flow:**
   - Login → Create products → Create requests → Approve → Dispatch → Confirm

2. **Verify data persistence:**
   - Refresh page and verify data loads from API
   - Check that all CRUD operations persist

3. **Test error handling:**
   - Try invalid credentials
   - Try operations without proper permissions
   - Test network errors

4. **Optional enhancements:**
   - Add pagination for large datasets
   - Add real-time updates (WebSocket/polling)
   - Add data caching/optimistic updates

## Troubleshooting

If data doesn't load:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API server is running
3. Check Network tab for failed requests
4. Verify authentication token is present
5. Check API response format matches expected structure

If images don't display:
1. Verify image URLs are correct
2. Check API server is serving `/uploads` directory
3. Verify CORS is configured correctly

## Testing Checklist

Before testing, ensure:
1. ✅ API server is running on `http://localhost:3001`
2. ✅ `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api`
3. ✅ Next.js dev server restarted after changes

### Test Flows

1. **Login Flow**
   - [ ] Login with valid credentials
   - [ ] Check token stored in localStorage
   - [ ] Verify dashboard loads based on role

2. **Super Admin**
   - [ ] View products from API
   - [ ] Create new product (with image)
   - [ ] Update product
   - [ ] Delete product
   - [ ] View admin requests
   - [ ] Approve/dispatch request (with image)
   - [ ] Reject request with reason

3. **Admin**
   - [ ] View agent requests
   - [ ] Approve/dispatch agent request (with image)
   - [ ] Request stock from super-admin
   - [ ] Transfer stock to another admin
   - [ ] Confirm receipt of dispatched stock (with image)

4. **Agent**
   - [ ] Create B2B sale (with all fields)
   - [ ] Create B2C sale (with all fields)
   - [ ] View sales from API
   - [ ] Create stock request (B2B/B2C)
   - [ ] Confirm receipt of dispatched stock (with image)

## Removed Mock Data

The following files no longer use mock data:
- ✅ `components/dashboards/super-admin-dashboard.tsx`
- ✅ `components/dashboards/admin-dashboard.tsx`
- ✅ `components/dashboards/agent-dashboard.tsx`
- ✅ `components/modals/product-modal.tsx`
- ✅ `components/modals/sales-modal.tsx`
- ✅ `components/modals/stock-request-modal.tsx`
- ✅ All hooks now fetch from API

## Notes

- The `lib/mock-data.ts` file still exists but is no longer imported anywhere
- Old `RequestApprovalModal` exists but is replaced by `EnhancedRequestApprovalModal`
- All image uploads support: JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF (max 5MB)
- Image URLs are automatically formatted using `formatImageUrl()` utility

## Next Steps

1. **Test the complete flow:**
   - Login → Create products → Create requests → Approve → Dispatch → Confirm

2. **Verify data persistence:**
   - Refresh page and verify data loads from API
   - Check that all CRUD operations persist

3. **Test error handling:**
   - Try invalid credentials
   - Try operations without proper permissions
   - Test network errors

4. **Optional enhancements:**
   - Add pagination for large datasets
   - Add real-time updates (WebSocket/polling)
   - Add data caching/optimistic updates

## Troubleshooting

If data doesn't load:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API server is running
3. Check Network tab for failed requests
4. Verify authentication token is present
5. Check API response format matches expected structure

If images don't display:
1. Verify image URLs are correct
2. Check API server is serving `/uploads` directory
3. Verify CORS is configured correctly

   - [ ] Request stock from super-admin
   - [ ] Transfer stock to another admin
   - [ ] Confirm receipt of dispatched stock (with image)

4. **Agent**
   - [ ] Create B2B sale (with all fields)
   - [ ] Create B2C sale (with all fields)

## Removed Mock Data

The following files no longer use mock data:
- ✅ `components/dashboards/super-admin-dashboard.tsx`
- ✅ `components/dashboards/admin-dashboard.tsx`
- ✅ `components/dashboards/agent-dashboard.tsx`
- ✅ `components/modals/product-modal.tsx`
- ✅ `components/modals/sales-modal.tsx`
- ✅ `components/modals/stock-request-modal.tsx`
- ✅ All hooks now fetch from API

## Notes

- The `lib/mock-data.ts` file still exists but is no longer imported anywhere
- Old `RequestApprovalModal` exists but is replaced by `EnhancedRequestApprovalModal`
- All image uploads support: JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF (max 5MB)
- Image URLs are automatically formatted using `formatImageUrl()` utility

## Next Steps

1. **Test the complete flow:**
   - Login → Create products → Create requests → Approve → Dispatch → Confirm

2. **Verify data persistence:**
   - Refresh page and verify data loads from API
   - Check that all CRUD operations persist

3. **Test error handling:**
   - Try invalid credentials
   - Try operations without proper permissions
   - Test network errors

4. **Optional enhancements:**
   - Add pagination for large datasets
   - Add real-time updates (WebSocket/polling)
   - Add data caching/optimistic updates

## Troubleshooting

If data doesn't load:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API server is running
3. Check Network tab for failed requests
4. Verify authentication token is present
5. Check API response format matches expected structure

If images don't display:
1. Verify image URLs are correct
2. Check API server is serving `/uploads` directory
3. Verify CORS is configured correctly
